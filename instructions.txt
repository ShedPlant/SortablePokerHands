A famous casino is suddenly faced with a sharp decline of their revenues.
They decide to offer Texas hold'em also online.
Can you help them by writing an algorithm that can rank poker hands?

Task:

Create a poker hand that has a constructor that accepts a string containing 5 cards:
hand = PokerHand("KS 2H 5C JD TD")
The characteristics of the string of cards are:
A space is used as card seperator
Each card consists of two characters
The first character is the value of the card, valid characters are:
`2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T(en), J(ack), Q(ueen), K(ing), A(ce)`
The second character represents the suit, valid characters are:
`S(pades), H(earts), D(iamonds), C(lubs)`

The poker hands must be sortable by rank, the highest rank first:
hands = []
hands.append(PokerHand("KS 2H 5C JD TD"))
hands.append(PokerHand("2C 3C AC 4C 5C"))
hands.sort() (or sorted(hands))
Apply the Texas Hold'em rules for ranking the cards.
There is no ranking for the suits.
An ace can either rank high or rank low in a straight or straight flush. Example of a straight with a low ace:
`"5C 4D 3C 2S AS"`
